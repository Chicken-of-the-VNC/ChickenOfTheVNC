Project Idea 1
Discover Your Northwest (DYNW) Seattle-based non-profit IT support

DYNW is a small non-profit located in Seattle with multiple satellite sites spread throughout federal lands in Northern California, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington. Our MSP company, Chicken of the VNC, will pitch a comprehensive plan to support the varied IT infrastructure (and hours and seasonality) of both the HQ office and the small, federal-land located satellite sites.
